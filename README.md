# Rock, Paper, Scissors... but make it Fashion

This project is a playful take on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, with a fashionable twist. The game is developed using React, TypeScript, and CSS, featuring unique icons for the choices.

## Features

User Choice and Computer Choice: Players can select one of the icons (ðŸ’Ž, ðŸª­, ðŸ‘ ) and compete against a randomly selected computer choice.

Game Logic: Determines the winner based on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors rules, but with a stylish twist.

Result Display: Shows the outcome of each round, indicating whether it's a win, loss, or tie.

Reset Functionality: Allows players to restart the game and play again.

## Technologies Used

React: A library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

CSS: For styling the application.

## Future Enhancements

Add sound effects for each choice.
